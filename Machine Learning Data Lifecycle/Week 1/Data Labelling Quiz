Question 1
Which factors substantially complicate production machine learning? (Check all that apply)

->Model Retraining driven by declining model performance.
Correct
Right choice! 

Model Retraining driven by model improvements

->Labeling through Weak Supervision
Correct
Nicely done! 

Ground truth that changes slowly 

Question2
Direct Labeling is one of the methods used in production ML to label data. About it we can say that: 

->It captures strong label signals
Correct
That’s correct!

It can be applied very often in many scenarios

With it, obtained labels don’t adapt quickly to world changes

->It needs to match prediction results with their corresponding original inference request.
Correct
That’s right! Feature selection identifies features with predictive power.

Question 3
A cardiologist labeling MRI images is a typical example of Direct Labeling.

True

->False
Correct
Great job! MRI labeling by a medical specialist is an example of Human Labeling
