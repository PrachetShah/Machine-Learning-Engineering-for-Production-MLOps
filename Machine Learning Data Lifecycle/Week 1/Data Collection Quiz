Question 2
A data pipeline is a series of data processing steps such as:

->Data collection

->Data ingestion  ( Data ingestion is the process of absorbing data from different sources and transferring it to a target site where it can be deposited and analyzed.)

Data Analysis

->Data Preparation

No

->Yes

4.
Question 4
What do you apply to maximize predictive signals in your data?

Data formatting

->Feature engineering

Feature selection

Data coverage

Question 5
Your training data should reflect the diversity and cultural context of the people who will use it. What can be done to mitigate inherent biases in a given data set?

-> Collect data from equal proportions from different user groups.

Commit to fairness.

Adapt to continuously changing data

Making predictions and decisions that preclude certain groups from accessing resources or opportunities.

Giving skewed outputs more frequently for certain groups of users

Inferring prejudicial links between certain demographic traits and user behaviors.
