1.
Question 1
Static datasets are used for production ML modeling.

False

-> True

Correct
That's it! Dynamic real-world data is used.

2.
Question 2
In production ML, the design priority is fast training.

-> No

Yes 
Too bad, wrong answer. The design priorities for production ML are fast inference and good interpretability.

3.
Question 3
Developers adhere to modern software development to produce low-maintenance software, and to address project evolution. Select all the key aspects of modern software development (Check all that apply):

->Best practices
Correct
Perfect! Software development best practices must be resolved.

Fast Training
This should not be selected
Sorry, that is incorrect. The model must be retrained based on changes in the data.

->Testability
Correct
Yes! The data entering the system is continuously monitored and tested.

->Monitoring
Correct
 Right on! The deployed model's performance is properly evaluated.

4.
Question 4
Model-performance needs to be continuously monitored, and new data, ingested and re-trained.

-> Yes

No

Correct
Good job! After deployment, it’s necessary to continuously evaluate the model's performance.

5.
Question 5
ML pipeline workflows are almost always DAGs.

->True

False

Correct
Well done! The components of an ML pipeline are scheduled based on dependencies defined by a DAG.

6.
Question 6
TensorFlow Extended (TFX) is an end-to-end platform for deploying production ML pipelines.

No

-> Yes

Correct
You got it right! TFX is used to create and manage a production line.

7.
Question 7
Production machine learning combines which two key disciplines?

->Modern software development
Correct
Keep it up! Well-designed software that adheres to best practices is key for the success of a production grade machine learning system.


Feature selection and engineering
This should not be selected
Try again. As a hint, what broad discipline encompasses feature selection?

Software testing

-> Machine learning development
Correct
Nice going! ML Development focuses on specific issues related with data and model predictions quality.

8.
Question 8
What are the unique challenges to overcome in a production-grade ML system? (Check all that apply

Assessing model performance.
This should not be selected
Not entirely accurate, as figuring out the right performance metric is a general ML challenge, but is not restricted to production systems. Please watch lesson 1’s video to review this information.

-> Optimizing computational resources and costs.
Correct
Absolutely! You want your ML system to be as frugal as possible.

-> Continually operating while in production.
Correct
Right on track! ML systems need to be flexible to operate while the system stages or modules are being changed or redesigned.

Training the model on real world data.
This should not be selected
Although a challenge for all ML, this is not strictly a production challenge. Please watch lesson 1’s video to review this information.


-> Building integrated ML systems.
Correct
Very well! ML systems perform all operations starting from ingesting the data into the system to deployment.


Deploying the model to serve requests.
This should not be selected
This might not be the case. While this is a fundamental aspect of ML systems, it is not a challenge to overcome. Please watch lesson 1’s video to review this information.


-> Handling continuously changing data.
Correct
Indeed! Data will change over the life cycle of a production system, which can harm its performance.

9.
Question 9
Production grade machine learning challenges are addressed by implementing an important concept:

-> Machine learning pipelines
Correct
Spot on! ML pipelines provide support for automating, monitoring and maintaining a model as you continue to train it over its lifetime.
Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)

Incorrect
There’s a slight mistake. The abstraction you are looking for is usually shaped as a DAG. Please watch lesson 1's video for a hint

Orchestrators
Incorrect
Getting close, but not quite. Orchestrators help to automate and monitor the abstraction you are looking for. Please watch lesson 1's video for a hint.

Tensorflow Extended (TFX) 

10.
Question 10
TensorFlow Lite is a deep learning framework to deploy TFX pipelines into:

->Mobile devices
Correct
That’s it! Tensorflow Lite is the tool for deploying TFX pipeline into mobile and IoT devices.
