-> True
False


3.Question 3
What statement is true about TensorFlow Transform?

TF Transform Analyzers are run during training and serving time
TF Transform requires specifying preprocessing steps at serving time
In a TFX pipeline, this component is usually placed after TF trainer
-> TF Transform eliminates the risk of introducing training-serving skew
