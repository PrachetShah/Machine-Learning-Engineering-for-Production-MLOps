Question 1
In the mapping of categorical values, can models directly multiply strings by the learned weights?

Yes
-> No
Correct! Feature engineering must be  applied in advance  to convert strings into numerical values.

Question 2
Feature engineering can be applied before modeling or be part of the model on the input stage. Regarding Feature Engineering, we can say that: (Only one correct answer)

TF Transform applies feature engineering separately from the model.
-> Feature Engineering within the model is limited to batch computations.
Feature Engineering within the model slows down iterations. 
Feature Engineering within the model reduces inference time.


Question 3
Which of the following is not considered a feature engineering inconsistency:

Diverse deployments scenarios
Training & serving code paths are different
->All transformations are the same in any scenario
Training-serving skews

Correct
Good job! Itâ€™s actually the other way around, this is pursued to reduce the risk of introducing skews.
